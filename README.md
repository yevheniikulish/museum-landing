This is a landing page of the NAMU. There're a header with a menu, a main title, a logo and links; a main block with some sections presenting events, lecture, gallery (slider on tablets and phones). The page also has a form with an email input. A footer of the landing page contains a logo, opening hours, social media links, contacts, navigation and copyrights.

I used such technologies as HTML, CSS, Sass, BEM to create this landing page.
